[00:35.42] Was a long and dark December, from the rooftops, I remember
[00:41.66] There was snow, white snow
[00:48.70] Clearly, I remember
[00:51.27] From the windows, they were watching while we froze down below
[01:22.27] 
[01:00.73] When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show
[01:09.56] You'd better lie low
[01:19.56] 
[01:13.37] If you love me, won't you let me know?
[01:32.37] 
[01:24.51] Was a long and dark December
[01:27.69] When the banks became cathedrals and a fox became God
[01:37.53] Priests clutched onto Bibles
[01:40.52] Hollowed out to fit their rifles and the cross was held aloft
[02:11.02] 
[01:50.37] Bury me in armor when I'm dead and hit the ground
[01:55.82] My nerves are poles that unfroze
[02:11.82] 
[02:01.93] And if you love me, won't you let me know?
[02:22.93] 
[02:24.54] (Ooh-ooh!)
[02:29.54] 
[02:38.83] I don't want to be a soldier
[02:41.89] Who the captain of some sinking ship would stow, far below
[03:10.89] 
[02:50.59] So if you love me, why'd you let me go?
[03:10.09] 
[03:03.49] I took my love down to Violet Hill
[03:09.56] There we sat in snow
[03:14.06] All that time she was silent still
[03:19.13] So if you love me, won't you let me know?
[03:27.24] If you love me, won't you let me know?
