Yeah we got a situation
Locked down and we're trapped in the basement
I'm a victim of pro-placement,
Cause you act and sound level
Trying to pull across your statement
Oh, oh
Because I know, you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied, ha ha ha I was right
All alone, good job,
Good job, you fucked it up

Because we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blueprint
But we threw it in the flame and now we're never gonna trace it
Oh, Because we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blueprint
But we threw it in the flame and now we're never gonna trace it
Oh

Because I know, you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied, ha ha ha I was right
All alone, good job,
Good job, you fucked it up

And now you're walking on your own
The rain falls down, I'm not answering my phone
I got to phase you out my zone,
Hope you realize now that I'm never coming home
You were meant to be alone

You, you lied, ha ha ha I was right
Ha ha ha
All alone, good job,
Good job, you fucked it up
Ha ha ha

It's the front
Good job, good job, you fucked it up
